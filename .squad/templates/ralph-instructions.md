# Ralph Instructions
<!-- User-owned: customize this file to override Ralph's autonomous-execution behavior.
     squad init creates this file on first install; squad upgrade never overwrites it. -->

<!--
  PURPOSE
  -------
  When `.squad/ralph-instructions.md` exists, `squad watch --execute` instructs the
  spawned Copilot session to read this file and follow ALL sections here instead of
  the built-in fallback prompt.  If the file is absent, the built-in prompt is used.

  CONTRACT (stable — safe to build on)
  --------------------------------------
  YOU CAN  customize via this file:
    • Extra instructions given to Ralph at session start (Teams/Slack notifications,
      calendar checks, post-task hooks, MCP-powered side effects, escalation paths)
    • Additional eligibility rules or priority ordering for issue selection
    • Agent persona, tone, or verbosity for session output

  YOU CANNOT override via this file:
    • Issue-drain safety — Ralph uses reserved waves of five, lower confirmed
      capacity, exact 10-second spawn-attempt pacing, and the created-child ACK barrier
    • Core eligibility filter (squad/squad:* label required, not blocked, not assigned)
    • The underlying `gh` / Copilot CLI command used to spawn each session

  TRUST IMPLICATIONS
  ------------------
  This file is read by the spawned Copilot session with full agent permissions.
  Treat it like code — never paste untrusted content here.  Anyone with write access
  to this file can influence what the agent does on your behalf.

  If this file is missing or empty, `squad watch --execute` falls back to the
  built-in prompt with no behavioral change.

  PLACEHOLDERS
  ------------
  The following values are injected by execute.ts before the session reads this file:
    (none currently — Ralph builds the issue list dynamically at runtime)

  FORMAT
  ------
  Plain markdown.  Structure with ## sections.  The spawned session reads the whole
  file, so keep it concise — one screen of instructions is ideal.
-->

## Ralph, Go!

Read this file for your full instructions.  Follow ALL sections.
MAXIMIZE SAFE PARALLELISM — enumerate all actionable issues, then admit them
through `.squad/skills/squad-issue-drain/PROMPT.md`. Reserve waves of five or
lower confirmed capacity. Launch one reserved member per exact 10-second
boundary without sleeping and without waiting for each individual ACK.

### Issue Selection

Work on every open, unblocked, unassigned issue labeled `squad` or `squad:{member}`.
Skip issues that are assigned to a human, blocked, or marked `status:on-hold`.
Before creating a child, atomically reserve its issue. A failed/ambiguous
creation, changed eligibility, lost capacity, or closed safety gate stops the
remainder of the wave. Keep every successfully created child owned and paused
until all such children return valid ACKs. Missing, negative, or corrupt ACKs
block the next wave; inspect once after five minutes and never replace an
uncertain child.

### Post-Task Actions

<!-- Uncomment and customize to add post-task hooks, e.g. Teams notifications:

After completing work on each issue:
- Post a brief summary to the team channel via your Teams MCP tool.
- Update the issue with a progress comment if no PR has been opened yet.
-->

### Escalation

If you are blocked on an issue, comment on it explaining why, add the appropriate
`blocked:dependency`, `blocked:evidence`, or `blocked:human` label, and move to
the next actionable item only after the current wave's stop and ACK state is
reconciled. Do not continue launching the remainder of a stopped wave.
